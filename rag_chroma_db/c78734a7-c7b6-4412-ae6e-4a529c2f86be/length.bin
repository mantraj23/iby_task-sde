Superior Predictive Accuracy : Compared to traditional models (e.g.,
Andrews' equation or thermodynamic models), BNNs demonstrate higher
accuracy across diverse steel grades, as validated against experimental
data.
Model Setup:
Define function:
              
                        Ms =f(W,W   , W   ,W   ,..., W) .C Mn Ni Cr Si
 Modeled using a neural network:
                       Ms=f(x ; w)‘›
